# Textmode Bots for PF2
This tutorial is made for a later version of Oanitic!
- So you decided to join me in my adventures
- Here is a few things you're gonna need
1. A bunch of steam accounts (3-5 for one attack is good enough)
2. Pre Fortress 2 (or any other TF2 Sourcemod)
3. The Oanitic Bot Build (CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE)
4. A good internet connection (else your bots gonna be really laggy and probably will break)
5. Sandboxie (So you can run multiple steam accounts)
- Now that thats outta the way lets get into the actual guide
- First step here is gonna be starting steam in sandboxed mode for all your bots
- Next you wanna copy paste this into each bot's launch options: -textmode -novid +sv_lan 1 +connect "SERVER IP GOES HERE"
- Make sure to replace "SERVER IP GOES HERE" with an actual server ip else the bots just wont work properly
- Start up all the bots games
- When the first bit of text appears on any of the console windows start injecting the bot build to all hl2.exe instances
- If a bot crashes during this process you are free to restart it whenever but make sure to inject the bot build before the bot joins
- Enjoy!
